<h1>About the Museum</h1>

<p>
I recently had to got to the museum for a class I'm taking.
I didn't feel right being there due to nearly everything there being <strong>innuendos</strong>.
And I do mean nearly everything, there were so many statues that looked <em>phallic</em>.
Despite my age, I didn't feel old enough to be there.
</p>

<h2> I saw a lot of things I wish I had not witnessed.</h2>
<ul>
<li>A film about a woman reading an innapropriate passage</li>
<li>A swatiska like arrangment of phallic shapes</li>
<li><a href= "https://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/marianna-simnett-blood-in-my-milk"/>A creepy film about a woman having varicose veins <a> (I missed the point of this film,so it may have been about something else)</li>
<li>Various innuendous statues</li>
</ul>
<p>The experience was near tramautizing</p>

<p>In contrast, here are things I would have rather done</p>
<ol>
<li>Get lectured by my parents</li>
<li>Clean dishes</li>
<li>Cook a meal I can't eat</li>
<li>Get hit by a bus</li>
<li>Have a conversation about politics</li>
</ol>
